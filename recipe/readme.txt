Hi there!!!

We created this website using an Online API to display recipes by giving the available ingredients as input.

This website has been created using HTML, CSS, javascript and different templates for design purposes.


User can simply choose between different pre-defined ingredients and based on those, the recipes will pop-up and a simple click can provide a list of all necessary ingredients and steps required to make the dish.

This website is created by Iqbal Singh & Lovepreet Kaur.
